The project shows how to project the content of a component into a modal.
<br/><br/>

This is useful for cases where the component size is smaller than its content size (e.g. card), 
and you want to comfortably view/edit that content in a modal instead of scrolling inside the component.
<br/><br/>

In case you edit the component the data binding remain when displayed in the modal.

# how to implement in your project

The project uses ngx-bootstrap to open the modal.
